Task 1. Optimization of production

The company produces two types of beverages: "Lemonade" and "Fruit juice". Different ingredients and a limited amount of equipment are used to produce these beverages. The objective is to maximize production given the limited resources.

Problem Conditions:

"Lemonade is made from Water, Sugar, and Lemon Juice. "Fruit juice" is made from "Fruit puree" and "Water". Resource limitations: 100 units of "Water", 50 units of "Sugar", 30 units of "Lemon Juice" and 40 units of "Fruit Puree". Producing a unit of Lemonade requires 2 units of Water, 1 unit of Sugar, and 1 unit of Lemon Juice. The production of a unit of Fruit Juice requires 2 units of Fruit Puree and 1 unit of Water.

Using PuLP, create a model that determines how much Lemonade and Fruit Juice should be produced to maximize the total number of products while respecting the resource constraints. Write a program whose code maximizes the total number of Lemonade and Fruit Juice products produced, given the resource constraints.

Calculate the definite integral

Task 2. Calculate the definite integral

Your second task is to calculate the value of the integral of a function using the Monte Carlo method.

Calculate the value of the integral of the function using the Monte Carlo method, in other words, find the area under this graph (gray area). Check the correctness of the calculations to confirm the accuracy of the Monte Carlo method by comparing the result with the analytical calculations or the result of the quad function. Conclude.

The program implements an algorithm for finding a certain integral using the Monte Carlo method. The code is executed and returns the value of the integral.

A comparative analysis of the result obtained using the algorithm with the result obtained analytically or using the quad function from the integrate submodule of the SciPy library is performed.

Conclusions about the correctness of the calculations are made by comparing the results obtained and the results obtained by the function quad or analytical calculation of the integral. The conclusions are presented in the form of a readme.md file of the homework.
